## 🚀 Final Steps (You Need To Do)

### Step 1: Install web-push
```bash
npm install web-push
```

### Step 2: Generate VAPID Keys
```bash
node scripts/generate-vapid-keys.js
```

This will output something like:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BK6x...
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=y7H...
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:your-email@example.com
```

### Step 3: Add Keys to .env.local
Create or update `.env.local`:
```env
# Push Notification VAPID Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:admin@yourschool.edu
```

### Step 4: Run Database Migration
In Supabase SQL Editor, run the file:
```
supabase/migrations/create_push_notifications_tables.sql
```

Or use Supabase CLI:
```bash
supabase db push
```

### Step 5: Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🐛 If Notifications Don't Work

**1. Check VAPID Keys:**
```bash
# Should show your keys
cat .env.local | grep VAPID
```

**2. Check Database Tables:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM push_subscriptions LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM notification_history LIMIT 5;
```

**3. Check Service Worker:**
- Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- Should show "activated and running"

**4. Check Browser Console:**
- Look for errors related to push or notifications
- Check if subscription was saved

**5. Check Server Logs:**
- Look for "Notification send request"
- Check for errors from web-push library
